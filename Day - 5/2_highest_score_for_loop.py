# You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.
# e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]
# Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e
# The highest score in the class is: x

# using for loop
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)

score = 0
for s_score in student_scores:
    if s_score > score:
        score = s_score

print(f"The highest score in the class is: {score}")

# using max function
# student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
# for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
#   student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
# print(student_scores)

# print(max(student_scores))
